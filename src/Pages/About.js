          My path to becoming a Full Stack Developer was not conventinal nor was
          it traditional. I spent 5 years at Rutgers University and that in it
          of itself was a journey. I graduated with a bachelor's in Journalism
          and media Studies, a minor in digital communiction, and then ending it
          with a Certifical in Digital Filmmaking. Pursuing Full Stack
          Developement came to me when I learned about the ins and outs of
          building full applications from front to back and learning different
          types of Languages. As someone who speaks different languages and
          apreciates the beauty of it, Coding was a natural fit and I have not
          looked back since.
